            <p>Turkers: Please read the following instructions carefully, even if you have completed HITs involving the LabelMe tool before.</br></p>
	    <p>

	    You will be shown an image.  The task is to  <b>1. Adjust proposed bounding boxes (labels with "proposed" in their name) and 2. outline and provide a name of all of the reasonably large (about as large or larger than a book) unlabeled objects left in the image</b>. Some images may not have many objects. Label as many as you can and once the image is finished, click the "All Objects Annotated" button. This will submit the HIT. 
	    
<!--	    <font color="red">Please do not label previously labeled objects as you will not receive credit.</font>-->
	    The HIT is
	    completed once all the objects in the image have been annotated.
	  </p>
	  <p>The following steps describe how to complete the HIT:</p>

	  <p>
        <u>NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT LABEL ANY HUMANS WHO APPEAR IN THE IMAGE. PLEASE ALSO DO NOT LABEL EMPTY WALLS. IF YOUR ENGLISH VOCABULARY IS POOR, I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO NOT DO THIS HIT - LABELS WITH WRONG OR MISSPELLED NAMES MEAN THAT YOU WILL NOT GET PAID.</u>
        <br/><br/>
          1. <b>Adjust and edit PROPOSED objects.</b> The objects with the word "PROPOSED" in their names are ones proposed by the computer. These proposed annotations will be approximately correct in location and shape, but may require editing. You can either adjust the existing polygon ("Adjust Polygon" button) or redraw the polygon completely ("Redraw Polygon" button). If the proposed object is not present (not in the image at all or not visible), you may click the "Object Not Present" button to delete the object. USE THIS BUTTON CAREFULLY - ONLY CLICK IT IF THE OBJECT THAT IS NAMED IS NOT PRESENT AT ALL. If the polygon is merely in the wrong place or the wrong shape, adjust or redraw the polygon instead. <b>New PROPOSED objects will periodically appear as the computer proposes new ones.</b> <br/><br/>

        <p>Editing a proposed bounding box.</p>
<br/> 
	  2. <b> Create bounding boxes and label (name) new objects. </b> Start by pressing the left 
          mouse button ONCE (single-click) at where you imagine the corner of the bounding box should be. If you double-click and label an object with a single point (no outline) <u>YOU WILL BE BLOCKED AND YOU WILL NOT BE PAID</u>.
	  <br /><br/> 3. Move your mouse to adjust the box's size. Make sure you capture the entire object inside the bounding box while making it small as possible (try to make the edges touch the object). Double click again once it is correct. DO NOT SPLIT ONE OBJECT INTO DIFFERENT PARTS. 
	  <br /><br/>4. A window will now appear asking for the object's
          name. Enter the object's name; as you type, there will be a dropdown menu with common names. You can select a name from the menu (recommended) or enter the name that you think is best.
            <br /><br/>5. If all reasonably sized objects in the image look like they have been labeled, click the "All Objects Annotated" button. This will submit the HIT. DO NOT CLICK THIS BUTTON IF NOT ALL THE OBJECTS HAVE BEEN ANNOTATED. Use your best judgement, but you will not be paid for submissions that are obviously incomplete.

        <p>Try to make your labels match the picture. Some proposed bounding boxes are provided for you to adjust.</p>

        <p><strong>Create polygon: </strong>To start a polygon, press the left 
          mouse button at some point along the boundary of the object.
           Continue clicking along the boundary of the object.</p>
        <p><strong>Close polygon: </strong>Once you have finished
          clicking along the boundary of the object, either click on
          the first point or press the right mouse button to complete
          the polygon. A window will appear asking 
          for the object's name.  Try to use common and
          short names to describe the object. Example object names: sky,
          tree, building, road, sidewalk, person, car, chair.  </p>

        <p>The following are some recomendations for how to provide annotations 
          that are as useful as possible. </p>
	  <p><strong>View the entire image: </strong> Make sure that
	  your browser occupies the entire screen and that you scroll
	  to see the entire image.  If you label an object on the edge
	  of your browser, make sure to scroll so that the entire
	  object is visible.
	  </p>
        <p><strong>Labeling occluded objects: </strong>Sometimes objects will 
          be only partially visible. This is especially true for regions like roads, 
          buildings, etc., which become difficult to label when there are many occlusions. 
          We recommend in these cases to complete the boundary as if they were not 
          occluded. </p>
        <p><strong>Object naming: </strong>Use common English names for objects. 
          Use a name that you think other people are likely to use to describe 
          the same object. You can use several words to describe an
          object.
	  Example object names: sky,
          tree, building, road, sidewalk, person, car, chair.	  </p>
